    DESCRIPTION
        Various implementations of the insertion sort algorithm

        The algorithm works by repeatedly iterating through the array,
        comparing the first element of the array with each of the following
        elements, swapping places, switching places if the first is
        larger. This puts the smallest element at the head of the array.

        Because of this, we need only to sort successively short array slices,
        ignoring the already sorted elements.

        Another way of putting this is that the array elements that are moved
        to the head of the array are all in their correct position, so we can
        ignore those elements as we progress further down the array.
